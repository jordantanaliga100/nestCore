## 🟢 Beginner Level: Fundamentals

### 1️⃣ Introduction to NestJS
- Understanding what NestJS is and why it’s a great choice compared to frameworks like Express or Koa.  
- Learning the architecture: **Modules, Controllers, and Providers**.  
- Setting up my development environment.  

### 2️⃣ Getting Started
- Installing NestJS CLI: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`.  
- Creating my first app: `nest new my-first-app`.  
- Exploring the project structure and conventions.  
- Running the development server.  

### 3️⃣ Core Concepts
- ✅ **Modules** – Organizing the app into logical units.  
- ✅ **Controllers** – Handling HTTP requests and defining routes.  
- ✅ **Providers** – Services and how Dependency Injection (DI) works in NestJS.  

### 4️⃣ REST API Basics
- Setting up routes and handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- Using **DTOs** and validating inputs with `class-validator`.  
- Implementing basic error handling.  

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Level: Real-World Patterns

### 5️⃣ Data Persistence
- Connecting to databases using **TypeORM** and **Prisma**.  
- Implementing the repository pattern for CRUD operations.  
- Using Mongoose for MongoDB support.  
- Handling transactions and database migrations.  

### 6️⃣ Configuration Management
- Managing environment variables securely using `@nestjs/config`.  

### 7️⃣ Authentication and Authorization
- Implementing **JWT authentication**.  
- Adding refresh tokens for session management.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Writing custom Guards and Interceptors.  

### 8️⃣ Middlewares and Pipes
- Creating custom middlewares.  
- Using pipes for input validation and transformation.  
- Handling errors with exception filters.  

---

## 🔵 Advanced Level: Enterprise-Grade Apps

### 9️⃣ Advanced Dependency Injection
- Exploring provider **Scopes**: Singleton, Request, Transient.  
- Creating **Dynamic Modules** and custom providers.  

### 🔟 Asynchronous Programming
- Using async providers.  
- Handling Promises and Observables properly.  

### 1️⃣1️⃣ WebSockets
- Building real-time communication with WebSockets and `@nestjs/websockets`.  

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Microservices
- Exploring microservices communication patterns.  
- Transport layers: TCP, Redis, NATS, MQTT, gRPC.  
- Using message queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka.  
- Implementing event-driven architecture.  

### 1️⃣3️⃣ GraphQL with NestJS
- Setting up a GraphQL API with **code-first approach**.  
- Writing resolvers, queries, and mutations.  
- Integrating with Prisma or TypeORM.  

---

## ✅ Testing

- Writing unit tests with **Jest**.  
- Performing end-to-end (E2E) tests using **Supertest**.  
- Mocking dependencies.  
- Testing Guards, Interceptors, and Pipes.  

---

## 🛡️ Security

- Securing HTTP headers with **Helmet**.  
- Enabling CORS and rate limiting.  
- Protecting against common web vulnerabilities.  

---

## 🚀 DevOps and Deployment

- Building production-ready NestJS apps.  
- Dockerizing applications for containerized deployment.  
- Using **PM2** for process management.  
- Deploying to AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean.  

---

## 🏆 Bonus: Productivity Tools

- Generating API documentation with **Swagger** (`@nestjs/swagger`).  
- Using GraphQL Playground for testing.  
- Enabling hot-reloading with `ts-node-dev`.  
- Setting up monorepos with Nx for managing large projects.
